notes:
  - Ansible uses the C(cs) library's configuration method if credentials are not
    provided by the options C(api_url), C(api_key), C(api_secret).
    Configuration is read from several locations, in the following order:
    - The C(CLOUDSTACK_ENDPOINT), C(CLOUDSTACK_KEY), C(CLOUDSTACK_SECRET) and
       C(CLOUDSTACK_METHOD) environment variables.
    - A C(CLOUDSTACK_CONFIG) environment variable pointing to an C(.ini) file,
    - A C(cloudstack.ini) file in the current working directory.
    - A C(.cloudstack.ini) file in the users home directory.
    See https://github.com/exoscale/cs for more information.
  - This module supports check mode.
